I am a an Associate Professor in the <a href="http://cse.buet.ac.bd/" target="_blank">Department of Computer Science and Engineering</a> at <a href="http://www.buet.ac.bd/" target="_blank">Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology</a>. I completed my PhD in Computer Science from The University of Texas at Austin ans was supervised by <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~tandy/" target="_blank">Prof. Tandy Warnow</a> and  <a href="http://www.ideal.ece.utexas.edu/ghosh/index.html" target="_blank">Prof. Joydeep Ghosh</a>.

My primary research interests lie in Computational Biology and Bioinformatics. I am interested in developing novel algorithmic approaches to solve different discrete optimization problems on species tree estimation, considering gene duplications and losses, deep coalescences, horizontal gene transfers etc. I also work on computational proteomics and interested in applications of machine learning in computational biology.
