<p> Please download the datasets and executable for QFM from <a href="datasets-PLOS-new.tar">here</a> 

<h4>Simulated datasets</h4>
<p>File contents:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simulated input quartets: datasets-PLOS-new/simulated-datasets/Ri.quartets-nX-qY-cZ.dat - where X is the number of taxa, Y is the number of quartets and Z is the percentage of erroneous quartets. For each model condition (X,Y,Z), we generated 20 replicates. Ri (i = 1, 2, ..., 20) refers to the i-th replicate. A quartet q = ((1,2),(2,3)); is represented as 1,2|3,4 which is the required format for QMC. datasets_PLOS/simulated-datasets/quartets-nX-qY-cZ.dat.newick contains the same quartets in newick format. Newick is the required format for QFM. </li>
<li>Model species trees: Model species trees for different model conditions can be found at: datasets-PLOS-new/Model-trees/Ri.tree-X-Y-Z.dat - where X is the number of taxa, Y is the number of quartets, Z is the percentage of erroneous quartets and Ri is the ith replicate.</li>

</ul>

<h4>Biological datasets: 18 gene trees on 25 species from 4 families of birds</h4>
<p>This dataset has originally been used to study the efficacy of species tree methods at the family level in birds, using the Australo-Papuan Fairy-wrens (Passeriformes:Maluridae) clade (Lee et al., Systematic Biology 61: 253-271. doi: 10.1093/sysbio/syr101).</p>
<p>File contents:</p>
<ul>
<li>gene tree: datasets-PLOS-new/bio-Australo/genetrees - this file contains the 18 gene trees downloaded from TreeBASE. </li>
<li>Induced quartets: datasets-PLOS-new/bio-Australo/all_genetree_quartets.newick - 227,700 induced quartets from the 18 gene trees. Taxa names have been mapped from the original names to integer labels. The corresponding mapping can be found at datasets-PLOS-new/bio-Australo/map.</li>
</ul>
